        This callback is called when the host probes the supported bus layouts via

        would like to limit the layouts that your AudioProcessor supports. The default
        implementation will accept any layout. JUCE does basic sanity checks so that
        the provided layouts parameter will have the same number of buses as your
        AudioProcessor.

    /** Callback to check if a certain bus layout can now be applied.

        Most subclasses will not need to override this method and should instead
        override the isBusesLayoutSupported callback to reject certain layout changes.

        This callback is called when the user requests a layout change. It will only be
        called if processing of the AudioProcessor has been stopped by a previous call to
        releaseResources or after the construction of the AudioProcessor. It will be called
        just before the actual layout change. By returning false you will abort the layout
        change and setBusesLayout will return false indicating that the layout change
        was not successful.

        The default implementation will simply call isBusesLayoutSupported.

        You only need to override this method if there is a chance that your AudioProcessor
        may not accept a layout although you have previously claimed to support it via the
        isBusesLayoutSupported callback. This can occur if your AudioProcessor's supported
        layouts depend on other plug-in parameters which may have changed since the last
        call to isBusesLayoutSupported, such as the format of an audio file which can be
        selected by the user in the AudioProcessor's editor. This callback gives the
        AudioProcessor a last chance to reject a layout if conditions have changed as it
        is always called just before the actual layout change.

        As it is never called while the AudioProcessor is processing audio, it can also
        be used for AudioProcessors which wrap other plug-in formats to apply the current
        layout to the underlying plug-in. This callback gives such AudioProcessors a
        chance to reject the layout change should an error occur with the underlying plug-in
        during the layout change.

        @see isBusesLayoutSupported, setBusesLayout
    */

    /** Callback to query if adding/removing buses currently possible.

        This callback is called when the host calls addBus or removeBus.
        Similar to canApplyBusesLayout, this callback is only called while
        the AudioProcessor is stopped and gives the processor a last
        chance to reject a requested bus change. It can also be used to apply
        the bus count change to an underlying wrapped plug-in.

        When adding a bus, isAddingBuses will be true and the plug-in is
        expected to fill out outNewBusProperties with the properties of the
        bus which will be created just after the successful return of this callback.

        Implementations of AudioProcessor will rarely need to override this
        method. Only override this method if your processor supports adding
        and removing buses and if it needs more fine grain control over the
        naming of new buses or may reject bus number changes although canAddBus
        or canRemoveBus returned true.

        The default implementation will return false if canAddBus/canRemoveBus
        returns false (the default behavior). Otherwise, this method returns
        "Input #busIndex" for input buses and "Output #busIndex" for output buses
        where busIndex is the index for newly created buses. The default layout
        in this case will be the layout of the previous bus of the same direction.
